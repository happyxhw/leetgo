 * Total Submissions: 1.3M
 * Testcase Example:  '"ADOBECODEBANC"\n"ABC"'
 *
 * Given two strings s and t, return the minimum window in s which will contain
 * all the characters in t. If there is no such window in s that covers all
 * characters in t, return the empty string "".
 *
 * Note that If there is such a window, it isÂ guaranteed that there will always
 * be only one unique minimum window in s.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
 * Output: "BANC"
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "a", t = "a"
 * Output: "a"
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5
 * s and t consist of English letters.
 *
 *
 *
 * Follow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(n) time?
