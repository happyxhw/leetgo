 * Testcase Example:  '"rabbbit"\n"rabbit"'
 *
 * Given two strings s and t, return theÂ number of distinct subsequences of s
 * which equals t.
 *
 * A string's subsequence is a new string formed from the original string by
 * deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the
 * relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ACE" is a
 * subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).
 *
 * It's guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
 * rabbbit
 * rabbbit
 * rabbbit
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation:
 * As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
 * babgbag
 * babgbag
 * babgbag
 * babgbag
 * babgbag
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 0 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000
 * s and t consist of English letters.
